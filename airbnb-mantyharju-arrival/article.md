1. Turn from Pertunmaantie road (at Pertunmaantie 449) to south to Varpuniementie road
1. Drive about 500 m along Varpuniementie road and near trash boxes turn right to Uitonniementie (Uitonniemenraitti) road.
1. About 500 m along Uitonniementie (Uitonniemenraitti) road, the road turns sharply right. Note that older maps and navigators incorrectly tell that Uitonniementie continues forward here whereas it nowadays turns right northward.
1. About further 300 m along Uitonniementie (Uitonniemenraitti) road, turn right at “Uitonniementie 86” sign. Note that Google Maps and some other older map apps do not show the road after this point (the road with blue color on the map above)
1. After about 50 m, turn left at “Uitonniementie 86 B” sign.
1. After about 100 m there is a hill down and you have arrived at the cottage. **In Winter do not drive down this last hill** since it's too steep and slippery (see Arriving and parking in winter" below)

## Arriving and parking in winter

Snow in winter can present challenges in using roads, particularly small countryside roads. We recommend a good winter-capable car, with good winter-tyres with spikes to drive on the icy road. Ideally 4WD. Drive slowly and carefully.

Cottage owner has agreement with a local snow-plough driver to remove snow from the last small roads leading to the cottage. The removal is agreed to happen within 24-hours after heavy snowfall (10+ cm of snow). This means that there might be temporarily snow on the road that hinders driving.

In winter when road has ice or snow *do not drive down the last downhill slope to the cottage*. The hill is too steep and slippery to drive back up so your car will be stuck.

Following picture shows map of the area with suggested winter parking locations:

![Winter parking locations](winter-parking-map.jpg)

* Blue circle has a parking place before the last hill to the cottage. This location is usually suitable and recommended for parking in the winter (see picture below)
* If the road is extremely slippery (wet ice), you don’t have an extremely winter-capable car or you are not an experienced winter-driver, you can consider parking even earlier to crossing (5) or (4). Note however, that if you park in the middle of the road, then the snow-plough cannot come to clean the road if there is snowfall so you might need to prepare for moving your car to allow snow-plough to pass when needed.

To get back from the winter parking place to Uitonniementie it might be necessary to back up (drive in reverse) up the hill, especially with a 2WD front-driving car, turning the car on the very slippery icy road can be difficult and lead to your car falling away from the road.

In case you get stuck with your car, you can try following things:

1. Shoveling away some snow around the car with snow-shovel outside the cottage.
1. Take some gravel from the two gravel boxes on the side of the road and spread to the road to increase friction.
1. Try using snow-chains (stored in the wood-shed near the cottage)
1. Finally if nothing else helps, you can call the snow-plough operator **Olli Halme** phone +358 40 524 5859 to come and pull your car. Address is Uitonniementie 86 B (house of Robert Brotherus). This will cost you extra if he needs to come urgently and not wait for the regular schedule.

## Using Taxi to arrive

I do recommend to come to the cottage with your own or rented car to have maximum flexibility eg. for driving to Mäntyharju town (10 min drive) for shopping when needed. However, it is also possible to come to Mäntyharju by train and then take a taxi for the last part.

## Key-box, Key and unlocking the doors

Cottage Key is stored in a combination-code key-box on the wall next to the villa main door:

![front-balcony.jpg](front-balcony.jpg)

<img height="300px" src="keybox.jpg"/>

When you have finalized your booking, please ask the owner for the current code to open the box.

After opening the door with the key and setting the door lock to “unlocked” mode:

<img height="300px" src="door-lock-switch.jpg"/>

After opening and unlocking the door, please immediately *return the key to the key-box*. We kindly ask all guests to *always quickly return the key in the key-box* to avoid losing the key or locking yourself out while the key is inside the villa. (However, if you nevertheless lock yourself out, contact the owner for help to get spare key)

It is typically safe to keep they door unlocked during your stay even if you go for a walk or shopping to the town. The cottage is in such remote and safe location that there are practically never unwanted visitors.

At the end of your stay, push the door locking switch back to locking mode, close the door and check that it is locked.

## Initial check for cleanness

Since the cottage is rented on a “self-service” basis, all guests have the responsibility to clean and arrange the cottage after their stay. Since as the owner I do not have possibility to visit the cottage after every guest, please after arriving, check that the previous guest have been cleaning and arranging properly after their stay:

1. Are the floors clean?
1. Are the dishes washed? (it is acceptable to have clean dishes in the dishwasher if the previous guests started the dishwasher but did not have time to finish it)
1. Is the kitchen clean?
1. Is the fridge clean? (it is acceptable to leave well-preserving items like butter and ketchup in the fridge)
1. Are items and furniture arranged neatly?
1. Is trash taken away?
1. Please check if the previous guests have left washed linen drying in the tumble dryer (in kitchen), hanging on the lines outside or hanging on the upstairs loft rail. If so (this is acceptable), please take to the linen box (or take it immediately to use for yourself).

Please report to the owner any significant uncleanness or other problems. If the problems cause significant extra effort for you, I will be happy to offer a discount in the cottage rent as compensation.
