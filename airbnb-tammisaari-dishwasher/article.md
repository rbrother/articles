## Quick instrucions

1. Pre-rinse dishes in the sink to reduce significant food remains. The dishwasher can become clogged if there is too much food waste inside.
1. Put dishes inside the dishwasher.
1. Put a small amount of dishwasher detergent powder to the dip on the inside of the door. Small teaspoon is enough since the machine is small. (Do not use detergent tablets since they are too big to dissolve.)
