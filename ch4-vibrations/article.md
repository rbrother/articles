# CH4 Anharmonic Vibrations project and leaving the academic world

After the successful drevelopment of [Infia spectrum analysis program](/post/infia) at Helsinki Universty Physical Chemistry laboratory in 1996-1999, professor Halonen suggested return to the theoretical work on Methane (CH4) anharmonous vibrational model. [LINK BACK FROM INFIA ARTICLE TO HERE].

In Aberdeen Sprint 1999 Xiao-Gong Wang, kiinalainen Britanniassa työskenetelevä Post Doc.

Esitti metaanin väeähtelyjä koskevan tutkimuksensa, joka oli juuri sitä

mitä minä olin ollut tekemässä. Minun täytyi vaihtaa aihetta.

(Wang did proceed in later years to publish many articles in the area)



(vrt yritysmaailma, jossa ei tarvitse olla maailman etunenässä vaan riittää että tekee "good job")



Beginning of the End



Syksyllä 1999 it was clear Halonen too that I was somewhat burned out



Tried something simpler: synthesis of DCCBr and more measurements. Setting out vacuum line.

(failure when the more advanced theoretical work did not pan out)

Did I learn in the end what matter really is? Asked Halonen if wavefunction is really existing of just a mathematical tool. Wikipedia says: "A wave function in quantum physics is a mathematical description of the quantum state of an isolated quantum system. [...] For a given system, the choice of which commuting degrees of freedom to use is not unique, and correspondingly the domain of the wave function is also not unique." -> same system can be descibed (validly) with many different wave functions -> not real.  Also not real in the sense that has dimensions as number of degrees of freedom.

Why did I leave for the industry?





The ghost of my father was guiding me but also stressing me when progress was stalled again and again. There are many stories of people struggling to rise from the shadow of their successful fathers, trying to rise to be worthy and adequate. It is at the same time ridiculous, ironic and frustrating that even the ghost of a father can create same effect - how futile it is to try to be worthy and adequate for a ghost, to strive for approval of the deceased? 



Stress was high



I love science and programming. 



Three failed projects provided depressing statistics for future prospects.



It's a blessing to want something, to have passion and work hard for that. But there must be balance to everything: to want something too much and too stubbornly can become a curse because then setbacks are taken too hard and there is too little flexibility, too much  "banging head againt wall" when things get hard. 



Meaning of life "Each one of us should carry a load as heavy as we can carry but no heavier"



Compare to industry (i had though running after the money in companies produced stress, but...)



Negative cycle from stress and creative work.



Halonen away (two times)



No psychological support (mostly only technical). Compare industry where psychological well-being of employees is important



I did really not want to leave. I had been extremely determined: "Academic career or Death." Fortunately did not quite come to death, but 



Opportuity: 2000 dotcom boom demand for developers, found chemistry-related SW work. During my 22 years in companies as SW developers, there have been moments of stress but never as high as on moments during the later part of my physical chemistry research. I did promise myself when I left that I will in future always be more flexible, that I will not let any aspect of career to become such an obession for me that I proceed . Giving up, moving on, trying someting different can sometimes be the best option.



Had got married and my wife was expcting our first child. This was a big cange and probably prompted somewhat out-of-the-box pondering of meaning of life and possibility for bigger changes in other areas of life like career as well. (Perhaps even worry of how I could be responsible and caring father for my child I had a work that sucked all energy from me in form of semi-continuos burn-outs)



Money did not play big role, but prospect of double salary when starting a family was still an advantage. And while it did not contibute much to my departure, it has probably contributed more to my later unwillingness to go return to academic career) 



Sheer co-incidence. Even with the pressure and reasons to move away, I could not 



It is worth noting the implication, that in the end the most successful project in my research career - Infia - was not a project suggested my professor, whereas from all the projects suggested by my professor and colleagues, one out of four succeeded and three lead to dead-ends for various reasons. There might be a lesson to consider here for people aspiring for academic research careers (or perhaps I was just unlucky)

...

After I had worked 6 months at Labsystems, Lauri Halonen called and suggested to return to finish PhD work. He gave reasons:.... (1) PhD needed if going to have academic career,  feeling of    

I thanked him for his but told I am not convinced of his reasons. Perhaps

...

15 years alter we met with Halonen in a    "It was the my biggest failure to let you go"    (still bit surprising considering that I did not succeed in producing novel theoretical contributions - the most valued in science)

And Software development has been the enduring passions that started at 9 and was very much present at my Physial Chemistry research years as well and ever since in my work and hobbies. That did not change in my jump to industry. But ...

Afterwards occasionally having recurring dream where I returned to University research, returned further development of spectrum analysis software. There was happiness in such dreams, showing that there was not full closure in the way my attempts for academic world ended.

"Akateemista ympäristöä enemmän häntä alkoi kuitenkin viehättää yksityinen sektori. - Koin akateemisessa maailmassa vieraaksi sen, että piti löytämällä löytää jotain uutta - olipa se tärkeää tai ei. Yksityisellä puolella tarpeellisuudelle on selvä testi: haluaako joku maksaa siitä. Minua motivoi työn hyöty. Toinen yliopistoyhteisössä Lukkaa häirinnyt asia oli akateeminen vapaus. Minulle se ei sovi kovin hyvin. "

Later I found some articles of my father that showed his interest in physics aspects of biochemistry, physical biochemistry.



Biochemistry and physical chemistry I perhaps aimed to know him and get closer to him.

Reflecting on my choice now in 2022, after 22 years as software developer in industry

* Career has been successful and I have been mostly happy (sometimes elevates stress levels, be never like at the university)

* could things have gone in other way?

* money problem in academic career, applying for money - that could provide additional stress which I did not have

* need to be best in some area

* companies have mechanisms for wellbeing

* also cases where software-projects have lead to dead-ends or cancelled by external forces after extensive work. Those also produced moments of upset, but the mental impact of those has been smaller than the dead-end projects at University. Why? Partly since I have been getting used to and grown up to be more mature and stable. Partly because there has been bigger teams sharing the work and hit (shared joy is double joy, shared sadness is half sadness). Partly because in career at industry companies, any learning and experience in a job is advancing my career / CV in itself without need for additional publications or degrees.
