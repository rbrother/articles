# Notes

- Mix more scenes and thoughts and events from the company with general description of the background of transformer. Avoid very long continuous blocks of background explanation.
- It is not realistic that the last discussion between Gordon and Irwin is so long when the building is already on verge of collapse. Make the last heated discussions between Gordon and Irwin shorter, perhaps some material can be moved to earlier discussion?
- Consider making Irwin a new employee that has already been hired, that might make it more sense for him to stay behind trying to fix the problem even when the shaking starts. We could make the interview part something that Gordon remembers from a week ago or so.
