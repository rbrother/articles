# Null and void

## Chapter 1

Gordon slowed his pace as he walked through the white production hall filled with shiny Zenekis transformers. "Any sufficiently advanced technology seems indeed indistinguishable from magic," he thought. How true: Even now, after watching the technology mature for twenty-five years and being one of the top experts in their science, Gordon still could not avoid a tingling magical feeling when he watched matter vanish in a whirl of green light and delicate objects materialize in their place. Human brain had been evolving in African savannah hunting and gathering. Human brain expected nature to behave according to the simple rules of Newtonian mechanics. Events that operated under more exotic laws of nature, like the quantum mechanical transformer, seemed indeed like magic to the brain.

The Zenekis transformer — more technically, the quantum-gravity wave transformer — had been made possible by the discovery of the quantum-gravity unified field equations by a group led by Professor Rudolph Zenekis in the 2080s. Gordon still remembered the excitement of being part of that group as a young research student. It took several decades for the theory to mature into the current state of the transformer technology, widely considered to be the most disruptive technology in all of human history: bigger than fire, steam, electricity, and even the microprocessor.

Many scientists, like Gordon, had chosen to move from basic physics research to industry positions helping to commercialize the technology. Just as unified quantum-gravity was seemed like the final and complete "theory of everything" in physics, the transformer seemed to many engineers like the final technology to complete all technology. It was indeed difficult to envision anything going beyond it: the creation of quantum wave patterns to mutate any type and form of matter to any other type and form of matter. What the microprocessor had done to allow complete freedom in processing of information, the Zenekis Transformer had done to allow complete freedom to process matter. It had naturally revolutionized production, the economy, and the job market — even politics — bringing a new era of human life on planet Earth.

## Chapter 2

Gordon's neural assistant chimed a reminder: "Production review meeting with Irwin Stone in 10 minutes, room Gamma, floor 20." Irwin was the latest member of company's transformer programming team, hired just a week earlier.

The possibilities of the Zenekis Transformers were limited only by imagination — and software. The complex dynamic quantum wave patterns in the Transformer made creation of everything possible in principle, but creating anything complex in practice was not simple: it required extensive programming at a level of complexity never seen in the history of software.

Irwin had joined the ranks of other whiz-kid programmers taking advantage of the booming new economy brought about by the transformers. Exceptional transformer programmers like him were extremely valuable to the new class of production companies and they could command matching salaries. And the great salaries caused virtually all kids with any talent to train and compete for such a career very early.

Gordon entered the software development room where Irwin was sitting in front of multiple screens. Gordon greeted him smiling:

- Hello Irwin, ready to rock?
- Hi Gordon, I have the programming environment up and running, all test runs pass in the emulator, so all should be good for connecting to production.
- Great, I will hook you in to one of the test-machines in proto-lab 4, let's start with a batch of ten unit of each product model and tomorrow we can proceed to expand to the main production hall. Then you need to re-install your language extensions to the production controller.

The immense economic incentive to maximize transformer production capabilities in addition to new programmers sprung up a whole new ecosystem of new programming languages, frameworks, and libraries. And the best of the transformer programmers were getting an edge in the competition by stretching even further than the status quo: developing their own proprietary custom variants of the languages and libraries.

Gordon had been conducting the technical assessment of Irwin as part of his interview week ago. Smart kid all right, sailing smoothly through the tasks of programming a transformed to produce increasingly complex objects in record time. And that success was partly because of custom looping extensions he had been developing to the already state-of-the-art Genial -programming language. Easy hiring decision.

## Chapter 3

Gordon was sitting in his office browsing through production reports. The numbers were good and growing, as usual: the total world production from transformers was already approaching half of the total global economy. The economic boom seemed to be without limits.

He heard a distant rumble. What was that..? Quiet again. Gordon returned to browsing the reports.

After a while, another distant rumble. His neural assistant chimed in: "Malfunction in proto-lab 4. Connection lost; reconnecting."

What the hell? Gordon stood up and commanded the assistant:

- Connect through the wireless network; visuals and status report from the lab cameras!
- Connection lost — wireless connection not available, secondary connection not responding, no sensory data available, visuals not available.
- Keep trying damnit!

A slightly stronger distant rumble. Gordon stood up and got out of the office. He started walking toward proto-lab 4 in the east wing of the building floor. In the long, white, winding corridors he passed many of his colleagues — puzzled scientists, engineers, and managers coming out of various rooms. "What is wrong? What is happening in proto-lab 4?" Gordon kept asking, but everyone was just shrugging in confusion.

A stronger rumble that shook the building. Corridor lights blinked off and then on again. Gordon hurried his pace. Red emergency lights came on and the fire alarm started blaring in the corridors. Neural assistant chimed: "Danger, danger. Building integrity abnormal. All personnel, proceed to emergency exits."
"Shut up!" responded Gordon. Now he was running through the corridors: left, right... and there was finally the door with the large label "Proto-lab 4". Gordon quickly pulled the door open.

On the other side of the door opened a vast, dark abyss, a bottomless pit hundreds of meters wide. Smoke and dust whirled in the air. Sun appeared only as a dim red disk behind the dust and smoke. A deep rumbling noise rose from the depths.

Gordon just stood there, stunned, his brain unable to make sense of the surreal, apocalyptic scene that had replaced the familiar white hall of proto-lab 4 and its neat rows of shiny devices and friendly personnel. On the far side of the huge pit, behind the cloud of dust, Gordon vaguely observed a tall skyscraper crumbling down and breaking up. The pieces continued to fall into the pit, disappearing into the dark depths. The abyss kept expanding.

## Chapter 4

After moment that seemed like eternity, Gordon was able to snap back into control. He slammed the door shut and started to withdraw from it, first carefully walking backward, then turning and running away, faster and faster, panting, his mind still blank about what he had seen. Now all electricity in the building had failed; the corridors were lit only by rows of red emergency lights. The sound of the blaring fire alarm was mixed with the steps and screams of colleagues frantically searching for any working exits. His neural assistant kept repeating: "Danger, danger, ..." in his head. But he was not going to evacuate, not now, not without trying to find our what had happened.

Gordon swung open the door of the software development room, out of breath. He saw Irwin staring at the Transformer control screens, frantically typing on the keyboard. His pale, sweaty face was illuminated only by the red emergency lights and green glow from the screen.

- What happened?! shouted Gordon with raspy voice.
- The system went crazy, I programmed the object transformations exactly as specified. There must have been some bug; I'm trying to reconnect!
- It's gone! It's all gone! The transformers are gone, the proto-lab is gone!
- What do you mean?! I am trying to restore the connection!
- Just show me the code!

Lines of Genial code flashed to the screen. Gordon was familiar with hundreds of programming languages, both dead and alive, including this recently fashionable syntax for efficient Transformer-programming. Nothing could go wrong with this language; it was impossible. He browsed frantically through the code, trying to spot something out of the ordinary. Loud rumbles were now echoing through the room and he could feel the building shaking with each.

Gordon stopped, stood, and stared. A dark, cold thought crept into his mind as he pointed at a location in the code:

- What is this?!
- It's the hook from Genial into my custom native looping extension.
- The debugger shows your extension is returning a null value here! How the hell did you do your extension?
- I found some old code from the 2060s, blazing fast in the tests... what do you mean "null value"?
- You kids don't know?! Well, I guess you wouldn't - it should not exists any more! Null means "nothing" and it was used in some long-gone languages to represent exactly that. It used to be endless source of bugs until the whole concept disappeared with the world moving to new generation of languages decades ago, even long before the transformer was invented. But your crap of an extension has brought that calamity here, returning null straight to the main Transformer software!
- So what! Let's fix the bug!
- You don't understand: such a possibility was never prepared for in the transformer control framework! A null value will propagate through the control code from function to function, all the way to the quantum wave pattern! Do you know what that means?!
- That the transformer produces...?
- Nothing! The transformer created a quantum wave pattern that will transform anything into *nothing*! It will consume any material and produce nothing! It will never complete anything, resulting in an infinite loop where the quantum wave simply sucks in any input material!
- Let's shut down the transformer then! I can access the logs and roll back my extension.
- You fool! Don't you get it? There is no more transformer, there is no more proto-lab, the first thing that such a rogue quantum wave pattern would do is to consume the electronics and casing of the transformer itself! There is just a naked quantum-gravity wave pattern sucking in rapidly anything on Earth!

In a thunderous boom the eastern wall of the meeting room collapsed away. Gordon and Irwin turned and saw the dark, ever-expanding abyss. The floor of the room began to crumble.
