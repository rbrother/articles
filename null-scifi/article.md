# Null and void

Gordon slowed his pace as he walked through the white production hall filled with shiny Zenekis transformers. "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic," he thought. Even now, after watching the technology mature for twenty-five years and being one of the top experts in his field, Gordon still could not avoid a tingling, almost magical feeling when he watched matter vanish in a whirl of green light and delicate objects materialize in their place. The human brain had evolved on the African savannah, hunting and gathering. The human brain expected nature to behave according to the simple rules of Newtonian mechanics. Events that operated under more exotic laws of nature, like the quantum-mechanical transformer, seemed like magic to the brain.

The Zenekis transformer — more technically, the quantum-gravity wave transformer — had been made possible by the discovery of the quantum-gravity unified field equations by a group led by Professor Rudolph Zenekis in the 2080s. Gordon still remembered the excitement of being part of that group as a young research student. It took several decades for the theory to mature into the current state of transformer technology, widely considered the most disruptive technology in human history — bigger than fire, steam, electricity, and even the microprocessor.

Many scientists, like Gordon, had chosen to move from basic physics research to industry positions helping to commercialize the technology. Just as unified quantum gravity had seemed like the final, complete "theory of everything" in physics, the transformer seemed to many engineers like the ultimate technology. It was difficult to envision anything going beyond it: the creation of quantum wave patterns to mutate any type and form of matter into any other. What the microprocessor had done for information processing, the Zenekis transformer had done for matter: allowing complete freedom to transform it. It naturally revolutionized production, the economy, and the job market — even politics — bringing a new era of human life on Earth.

Gordon's neural assistant chimed a reminder: "Production review meeting with Irwin Stone in 10 minutes, software room Gamma, floor 20." Irwin was the latest member of the company's transformer programming team, hired just a week earlier.

The possibilities of the Zenekis transformers were limited only by imagination — and software. The complex, dynamic quantum wave patterns in the transformer made creation of everything possible in principle, but creating anything complex in practice was not simple: it required extensive programming at a level of complexity never seen in the history of software development.

Irwin had joined the ranks of other whiz-kid programmers taking advantage of the booming new economy brought about by the transformers. Exceptional transformer programmers like him were extremely valuable to the new class of production companies and could command very high salaries. Such salaries in turn led virtually all talented kids to train and compete for such careers from an early age.

Gordon entered the software development room where Irwin sat in front of multiple screens and greeted him, smiling:

- Hello Irwin, ready to rock?
- Hi Gordon, I have the programming environment up and running, all test runs pass in the emulator, so all should be good for connecting to production.
- Great, I will hook you in to one of the test-machines in proto-lab 4, let's start with a batch of ten unit of each product model and tomorrow we can proceed to expand to the main production hall. Then you need to re-install your language extensions to the production controller.

The immense economic incentive to maximize transformer production capabilities, and the influx of new programmers, had spawned a whole new ecosystem of programming languages, frameworks, and libraries. And the best transformer programmers like Irwin were getting an edge in the competition by developing proprietary variants of languages and libraries.

Gordon had been conducting the technical assessment of Irwin as part of his interview a week ago. Smart kid, all right, sailing smoothly through the tasks of programming a transformer to produce increasingly complex objects in record time. That success was partly because of custom looping extensions he had been developing for the already state-of-the-art Genial programming language. Easy hiring decision.

Gordon was sitting in his office browsing through production reports. The numbers were good and growing, as usual: total world production by transformers was already approaching half of the global economy. The economic boom seemed to have no limits.

He heard a distant rumble. What was that? Quiet again. Gordon returned to browsing the reports.

After a while, another distant rumble. His neural assistant chimed in: "Malfunction in proto-lab 4. Connection lost; reconnecting."

What the hell? Gordon stood up and commanded the assistant:

— Connect through the wireless network; visuals and status report from the lab cameras!  
— Connection lost — wireless connection not available, secondary connection not responding, no sensory data available, visuals not available.  
— Keep trying, damn it!

A slightly stronger distant rumble. Gordon left his office and started walking toward proto-lab 4 in the east wing of the building. In the long, white, winding corridors he passed many of his colleagues — puzzled scientists, engineers, and managers coming out of various rooms. "What is wrong? What is happening in proto-lab 4?" Gordon kept asking, but everyone just shrugged in confusion.

A stronger rumble shook the building. Corridor lights blinked off and then on again. Gordon quickened his pace. Red emergency lights came on and the fire alarm started blaring in the corridors. His neural assistant chimed: "Danger, danger. Building integrity abnormal. All personnel, proceed to emergency exits."
"Shut up!" responded Gordon. He ran through the remaining corridors: left, right... and finally reached the door with the large label "Proto-lab 4". Gordon quickly pulled the door open.

On the other side was just a vast, dark abyss — a bottomless pit hundreds of meters wide. Smoke and dust whirled in the air. The sun appeared only as a dim red disk behind the dust and smoke. A deep rumbling rose from the depths.

Gordon just stood there, stunned, his brain unable to make sense of the surreal, apocalyptic scene that had replaced the familiar white hall of proto-lab 4 and its neat rows of shiny devices and friendly personnel. On the far side of the huge pit, behind the cloud of dust, Gordon vaguely saw a tall skyscraper crumbling. The massive chunks continued to fall into the pit, disappearing into the dark depths. The abyss kept expanding.

After a moment that seemed like an eternity, Gordon was able to snap back into control. He slammed the door shut and started to withdraw from it, first carefully walking backward, then turning and running away, faster and faster, panting, his mind still blank about what he had seen. Now all electricity in the building had failed; the corridors were lit only by rows of red emergency lights. The blaring fire alarm mixed with the steps and screams of colleagues frantically searching for any working exits. His neural assistant kept repeating: "Danger, danger, ..." in his head. But he was not going to evacuate, not now, not without trying to find out what had happened.

Gordon swung open the door of the software development room, out of breath. He saw Irwin staring at the transformer control screens, frantically typing on the keyboard. Irwin's pale, sweaty face was illuminated only by the red emergency lights and the green glow from the screen.

— What happened?! shouted Gordon in a raspy voice.  
— The system went crazy! I programmed the object transformations exactly as specified. There must be a bug; I'm trying to reconnect to debug.  
— It's gone! It's all gone! The transformers are gone, the proto-lab is gone!  
— What do you mean?! I'm trying to restore the connection!  
— Just show me the code!

Lines of Genial code flashed across the screen. Gordon was familiar with hundreds of programming languages, both dead and alive, including this recently fashionable syntax for efficient transformer programming. Nothing could go wrong with this language; it seemed impossible. He browsed frantically through the code, trying to spot something out of the ordinary. Loud rumbles were now echoing through the room and he could feel the building shaking with each.

Gordon stopped, stood, and stared. A dark, cold thought crept into his mind as he pointed at a location in the code:

— What is this?!  
— It's the hook from Genial into my custom native looping extension.  
— The debugger shows your extension is returning a null value here! How the hell did you do your extension?  
— It's old code I found from the 2060s, fastest results in looping tests... what do you mean by "null value"?  
— You kids don't know?! Well, I guess you wouldn't — it should not exist anymore! Null means "nothing" and it was used in some long-gone languages to represent exactly that. It used to be an endless source of bugs until the concept disappeared as the world moved to a new generation of languages decades ago, long before the transformer was invented. But your ancient hack of an extension has brought that calamity here, returning a null straight to the main transformer software!  
— So what! Let's fix the bug!  
— It's too late now! A null value would propagate through the transformer control framework, all the way to the quantum wave pattern! Do you know what that means?!  
— That the transformer produces...?  
— Nothing! The transformer has created a quantum wave pattern that transforms anything into nothing! It will just consume any material and produce nothing! It will never complete; it will result in an infinite loop where the quantum wave simply sucks in any input material!  
— Let's shut down the transformer then!
— You fool! Don't you get it? There is no more transformer, there is no more proto-lab — the first thing that such a rogue quantum wave pattern would do is to eat the electronics and casing of the transformer device around it! There is now just a naked quantum-gravity wave pattern rapidly sucking in anything on Earth!  

In a thunderous boom the eastern wall of the software development room collapsed away. Gordon and Irwin turned and saw the dark, ever-expanding abyss. The floor of the room began to crumble.
