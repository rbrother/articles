# Null and void

## Chapter 1

Gordon slowed his pace as he walked through the white production hall filled with shiny Zenekis transformers. "Any sufficiently advanced technology seems indeed indistinguishable from magic", he thought. Still now, even after watching the technology mature for 25 years and being one of the best experts on both the technology and the science behind it, Gordon still could not avoid some tingles of magical feeling when he watched matter vanish in a whirl or green glow and delicate objects materialize in their place. Human brain had been evolving to expect nature to behave according to simple rules of Newtonian mechanics. Events that operated on the more exotic laws of nature seemed just magic to the brain.

The Zenekis transformer - or more technically Quantum-gravity wave transformer - had been made possible by discovery of the quantum gravity unified field equations by group of professor Rudolph Zenekis in the 2080s. Gordon still remembered the excitement of being part of that group as a young research student. It took several decades for the theory to mature into the current state of the transformer technology, widely considered to be the most disruptive technology of all human history, even bigger than fire, steam, electricity and the microprocessor.

Many scientists had like Gordon chosen to move from basic physics research to various industry positions helping to commercialize the technology. Just like the unified quantum-gravity was considered by widely the final and complete "theory of everything" in physics, the transformer seemed to many engineers like a final technology to complete all technology. It was indeed difficult to envision anything going beyond it: creation of quantum wave patterns to mutate any type and form of matter to any other type and form of matter. What microprocessor had done to allow processing of information in any desired way, Zenekis Transformer had done to freely process and transform matter. It had naturally revolutionized the production, economy and job-market - even politics - nothing short of bringing a new ara of human life on planet earth.

## Chapter 2

Gordon's neural assistant chimed a reminder: "Interview of Irwin Stone, meeting room Gamma, floor 20." Ah, the new Transformer programming candidate, remembered Gordon.

The limit of possibilities for the Zenekis Transformers was only imagination - and software. The complex dynamic quantum wave patterns in the Transformer made everything possible, but creating them was not simple: it required extensive programming on level of complexity never seen in the history of software. A whole new ecosystem of programming languages, frameworks and libraries had been emerging and evolving for the purpose and a new crop of whiz-kid programmers growing up to master them.

From early experiments of simple forms of various atoms, the art had progressed immensely to the current creation of sophisticated machines with multiple internal parts, materials, electronics and even soft parts. As the new industry progressed, conventional factories were one by one being replaced by ever increasing number of halls filled with transformer devices.

Gordon had never considered himself a people person and he would have preferred company's HR staff to handle the interview process completely. But the HR department kept reminding him that the real-life testing of technical skills was essential and that no-one in the company had better experience and understanding for performing such testing than Gordon.

Gordon stepped inside the meeting room. The guy sitting inside seemed to Gordon even younger than the previous crop of Transformer wizards he had interviewed.

- Irwin Stone?
- Yes, that's me, nice to meet you!
- I am Gordon Wood, I understand that our HR people have been introducing me...?
- Yes, although that was not really needed, I had already read about your early work with professor Zenekis and later work with transformers.
- Ok, then they must have been briefing you also already about the kind of test assignments we use in these interviews. You get extra points if you complete all objects below the nominal time, but take care that you are not skipping any part of the specifications.
- Yes, we had preliminary discussion on that. Can I use any programming-frameworks?
- We don't limit the software tools any more than other companies. What did you have in mind?
- I am currently using the core from the Cambridge-variant of the RAPTOR-framework, the release 2117.2. It's based on the Genial-language but I have added custom native looping extensions for faster creation of small recursive structures.
- Fine. You can work on the test assignments to create objects in increasing order of complexity. Here are high-level specifications for each, but feel free to improvise on the details to demonstrate your design skills. I will connect your computer to our test transformer in proto-lab 4.

Gordon used the keyboard to set up the connection parameters and user-interface transformer interface software popped on the computer screen.

- Ok, good luck, I will be back in an hour, good luck.

## Chapter 3

Gordon was sitting in his office browsing through production reports. The numbers were good and growing, as usual: the total production from transformers was already approaching half of the total global economy.

Irwin would likely get a fair share of that. In the booming new economy brought about by the transformers the particularly skilled transformer programmers were extremely valuable for the production companies and they could command salaries to match.

There was logic to that: the possible monetary reward for being hired as a transformer programmer to one of the big companies was so immense that virtually all kids having any talent for the art were starting to train for such career very early. Yet Gordon could not avoid feeling weird about the idea that the kid in meeting room Gamma was likely to start getting millions per month next week for hacking some clever lines of code.

Gordon heard some distant rumble. What was that? He returned to browsing the reports.

Another distant rumble. His neural assistant chimed: "Malfunction in proto-lab 4. Connection lost, reconnecting"

What the hell? Gordon stood up and commanded his neural assistant:

- Connect through the wireless network, show visual from the lab cameras!
- Connection lost, wireless connection lost, visuals not available.
- Keep trying to reconnect!

Slightly stronger distant rumble. Gordon got out of the office and started walking towards the proto-lab 4 in the east wing of the building through white winding corridors. Many of his colleagues, puzzled scientists, engineers and planners were coming out from various rooms. "What is wrong?! What is happening in proto-lab 4?!" he shouted to confused colleagues who just shrugged with even less understanding.

Stronger rumble shook the building. Corridor lights blinked off and on again. Red emergency lighting come on and fire-alarm started blasting in the corridors. Gordon's neural assistant chimed in: "Danger, Danger, Proceed immediately to emergency exits."
"Shut up!" responded Gordon. Now he was running through the corridors: still left here, right there... and there was the door with large label "Proto-lab 4". Gordon pulled the door open.

There was no proto-lab 4. On the other side of the door opened just vast dark abyss: deep and wide pit with smoke and dust whirling in the air and loud rumbling sound from the depths.

Gordon just stood there stunned with shock, his brain unable to make sense of the surreal apocalyptic scene that had replaced the familiar white hall of proto-lab 4 with its neat rows of shiny laboratory devices and personnel. On the other side of the huge pit, behind the cloud of dust, Gordon vaguely saw a tall sky-scraper crumble down and break to pieces. The pieces continued to fall down to the pit and disappeared to the dark depth. The abyss was expanding.

## Chapter 4

After the moment of shock that seemed like an eternity, Gordon was finally able to snap back to control. He banged the door shut and started withdraw from it, first carefully stepping backwards, then turning and running away, faster and faster, still his mind blank on what he had seen. Now all electricity in the building had failed, the corridors were lit only by the rows of red emergency lights. The ringing of fire-alarms mixed with steps and screams of colleagues frantically searching for any working exits. His neural assistant kept repeating "please evacuate the building" in his head. But he was not going to evacuate, not now, not without going to see what had happened in meeting room Gamma.

Gordon swinged open the door of meeting room, panting. Irwin was still there, staring at the Transformer control application screen, frantically typing on the keyboard, his pale sweaty face illuminated only by the emergency lights and green light from the screen.  

- What happened?! shouted Gordon
- I programmed the object transformations exactly as specified. But there must have been some bug, I am trying to reconnect to fix it!
- ItÂ´s gone! It's all gone! The transformers are gone, the proto-lab is gone!
- What do you mean?! I am trying to restore connection.
- Just show me the code!

Lines of Genial-code flashed to the screen. Gordon was familiar with hundreds of programming languages, both dead and alive, including this recently fashionable Transformer-programming syntax. Nothing *could* go wrong with this framework, it was *impossible*. He browsed frantically through the code trying to spot something out of the ordinary. Loud rumbles were now echoing though the room and they could feel the building shaking at each.

Gordon stopped, stood and stared. A dark cold thought crept to his mind as he pointed at a location in the code:

- What is this?!
- This is where I am hooking to my custom native looping extension from Genial.
- The debugger shows your rogue extension is returning a null value here! What is this extension?
- Some old code I found from 2060s, blazing fast with looping... What is a "null value"?
- Something you youngsters would not know. Something that should not exist! For the past fifty years, no-one in the world has used any programming language that allows null-values. It means "nothing" and was used in some long-gone languages to mean exactly that.

Irwin just stared at him blankly

- Now bug in your hacking with the ancient code has caused a null value enter into the main Transformer program code!
- So what?! Let's fix the bug!
- You don't understand: Such possibility was never prepared in the transformer control framework! A null-value will propagate in the framework from function to function, all the way to the resulting quantum wave pattern! Do you know what that means?!
- That the transformer produces...
- Nothing! The transformer produced a quantum wave pattern that will transforms anything into *nothing*! It will consume any material and produce nothing! It will never complete anything, resulting in an infinite loop where the quantum wave destroys all material around it without any limit!
- Then shut it down!
- You fool! The first thing that such rogue wave pattern consumes is that casing and electronics of the transformer itself! There is no transformer machine anymore, just a naked quantum-gravity wave sucking in anything on earth *fast*!

In a loud rumble the eastern wall of the meeting room collapsed away, exposing view to the dark ever-expanding abyss. The floor of the room started to crumble away.
