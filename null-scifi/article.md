# Null and void

## Chapter 1

Gordon slowed his pace as he walked through the white production hall filled with shiny Zenekis transformers. "Any sufficiently advanced technology seems indeed indistinguishable from magic," he thought. Even now, after watching the technology mature for twenty-five years and being one of the leading experts on both the technology and the science behind it, Gordon still could not avoid some tingles of magical feeling when he watched matter vanish in a whirl of green light and delicate objects materialize in their place. The human brain had evolved to expect nature to behave according to the simple rules of Newtonian mechanics. Events that operated under more exotic laws of nature seemed like magic to the brain.

The Zenekis transformer — more technically, the quantum-gravity wave transformer — had been made possible by the discovery of the quantum-gravity unified field equations by a group led by Professor Rudolph Zenekis in the 2080s. Gordon still remembered the excitement of being part of that group as a young research student. It took several decades for the theory to mature into the current state of the transformer technology, widely considered to be the most disruptive technology in all of human history, even bigger than fire, steam, electricity, and the microprocessor.

Many scientists, like Gordon, had chosen to move from basic physics research to industry positions helping to commercialize the technology. Just as unified quantum-gravity was widely considered the final and complete "theory of everything" in physics, the transformer seemed to many engineers like the final technology to complete all technology. It was indeed difficult to envision anything going beyond it: the creation of quantum wave patterns to mutate any type and form of matter to any other type and form of matter. What the microprocessor had done to allow processing of information in any desired way, the Zenekis Transformer had done to freely process and transform matter. It had naturally revolutionized production, the economy, and the job market — even politics — bringing a new era of human life on planet Earth.

## Chapter 2

Gordon's neural assistant chimed a reminder: "Interview of Irwin Stone, meeting room Gamma, floor 20." Ah, the new Transformer programming candidate, Gordon remembered.

The limits of possibility for the Zenekis Transformers were only imagination — and software. The complex dynamic quantum wave patterns in the Transformer made everything possible, but creating them was not simple: it required extensive programming at a level of complexity never seen in the history of software. A whole new ecosystem of programming languages, frameworks, and libraries had been emerging and evolving for the purpose, and a new crop of whiz-kid programmers was growing up to master them.

From early experiments with simple forms of various atoms, the art had progressed immensely to the current creation of sophisticated machines with multiple internal parts, materials, electronics, and even soft parts. As the new industry progressed, conventional factories were one by one being replaced by an ever-increasing number of halls filled with transformer devices.

Gordon had never considered himself a people person, and he would have preferred the company's HR staff to handle the interview process completely. But the HR department kept reminding him that the real-life testing of technical skills was essential and that no one in the company had more experience or better understanding for performing such testing than Gordon.

Gordon stepped inside the meeting room. The guy sitting inside seemed even younger to Gordon than the previous crop of Transformer wizards he had interviewed.

- Irwin Stone?
- Yes, that's me, nice to meet you!
- I am Gordon Wood. I understand that our HR people have been introducing me...?
- Yes, although that was not really needed. I had already read about your early work with Professor Zenekis and your later work with transformers.
- Ok, then they must have already briefed you about the kind of test assignments we use in these interviews. You get extra points if you complete all objects within the nominal time, but take care not to skip any part of the specifications.
- Yes, we had a preliminary discussion on that. Can I use any programming frameworks?
- We don't limit software tools any more than other companies. What did you have in mind?
- I am currently using the core from the Cambridge variant of the RAPTOR framework, the release 2117.2. It's based on the Genial language, but I have added custom native looping extensions for faster creation of small recursive structures.
- Fine. You can work on the test assignments to create objects in increasing order of complexity. Here are high-level specifications for each, but feel free to improvise on the details to demonstrate your design skills. I will connect your computer to our test transformer in proto-lab 4.

Gordon set up the connection parameters and the user-interface of the transformer software popped up on the computer screen.

- Ok, good luck. I will be back in an hour.

## Chapter 3

Gordon was sitting in his office browsing through production reports. The numbers were good and growing, as usual: the total production from transformers was already approaching half of the total global economy.

Irwin would likely get a fair share of it. In the booming new economy brought about by the transformers, particularly skilled transformer programmers were extremely valuable to production companies and could command matching salaries.

There was logic to it: the possible monetary reward for being hired as a transformer programmer at one of the big companies was so immense that virtually all kids with any talent for the art were starting to train for such a career very early. Yet Gordon could not avoid feeling weird about the idea that the kid in meeting room Gamma would likely start getting millions per month next week for writing some clever lines of code.

Gordon heard a distant rumble. What was that? He returned to browsing the reports.

After a while, another distant rumble. His neural assistant chimed, "Malfunction in proto-lab 4. Connection lost; reconnecting."

What the hell? Gordon stood up and commanded the assistant:

- Connect through the wireless network; show visuals from the lab cameras!
- Connection lost — wireless connection lost, visuals not available.
- Keep trying!

A slightly stronger distant rumble. Gordon got out of the office and started walking toward proto-lab 4 in the east wing of the building, through white, winding corridors. Many of his colleagues — puzzled scientists, engineers, and managers — were coming out of various rooms. "What is wrong?! What is happening in proto-lab 4?!" Gordon shouted to confused colleagues who just shrugged with even less understanding.

A stronger rumble that shook the building. Corridor lights blinked off and on again. Red emergency lighting came on and the fire alarm started blaring in the corridors. Gordon's neural assistant chimed in, "Danger, danger. Proceed immediately to emergency exits."
"Shut up!" responded Gordon. Now he was running through the corridors: left, right... and there was the door with the large label "Proto-lab 4". Gordon quickly pulled the door open.

There was no proto-lab 4. Instead, on the other side of the door opened a vast, dark abyss: a deep, wide pit with smoke and dust whirling in the air and a loud rumbling sound rising from the depths.

Gordon stood there, stunned, his brain unable to make sense of the surreal, apocalyptic scene that had replaced the familiar white hall of proto-lab 4 and its neat rows of shiny laboratory devices and personnel. On the far side of the huge pit, behind the cloud of dust, Gordon vaguely saw a tall skyscraper crumble down and break to pieces. The pieces continued to fall into the pit and disappeared into the dark depths. The abyss was expanding.

## Chapter 4

After the moment of shock that seemed like an eternity, Gordon was finally able to snap back into control. He banged the door shut and started to withdraw from it, first carefully stepping backward, then turning and running away, faster and faster, his mind still blank about what he had seen. Now all electricity in the building had failed; the corridors were lit only by rows of red emergency lights. The blaring fire alarm mixed with the steps and screams of colleagues frantically searching for any working exits. His neural assistant kept repeating "Danger, danger, ..." in his head. But he was not going to evacuate, not now, not without going to see what had happened in meeting room Gamma.

Gordon swung open the door of the meeting room, panting. He saw Irwin staring at the Transformer control screen, frantically typing on the keyboard. His pale, sweaty face was illuminated only by the red emergency lights and green glow from the screen.

- What happened?! shouted Gordon
- I programmed the object transformations exactly as specified. But there must have been some bug; I'm trying to reconnect to fix it!
- It's gone! It's all gone! The transformers are gone, the proto-lab is gone!
- What do you mean?! I am trying to restore the connection.
- Just show me the code!

Lines of Genial code flashed on the screen. Gordon was familiar with hundreds of programming languages, both dead and alive, including this recently fashionable Transformer-programming syntax. Nothing could go wrong with this framework; it was impossible. He browsed frantically through the code, trying to spot something out of the ordinary. Loud rumbles were now echoing through the room and they could feel the building shaking with each.

Gordon stopped, stood, and stared. A dark, cold thought crept into his mind as he pointed at a location in the code:

- What is this?!
- This is where I am hooking Genial into my custom native looping extension.
- The debugger shows your rogue extension is returning a null value here! What is this extension?
- Some old code I found from the 2060s, blazing fast with looping... But what is a "null value"?
- Something you rookies would not know. Something that should not exist! For the past fifty years, no one in the world has used any programming language that uses null values. It means literally "nothing" and was used in some long-gone languages to mean exactly that.

Irwin just stared at him blankly.

- A bug in your hacking with the ancient code has caused a null value to enter the main Transformer program code!
- So what?! Let's fix the bug!
- You don't understand: such a possibility was never prepared for in the transformer control framework! A null value will propagate through the framework from function to function, all the way to the quantum wave pattern! Do you know what that means?!
- That the transformer produces...
- Nothing! The transformer created a quantum wave pattern that will transform anything into *nothing*! It will consume any material and produce nothing! It will never complete anything, resulting in an infinite loop where the quantum wave destroys all material around it without limit!
- Then shut it down!
- You fool! The first thing that such a rogue wave pattern would consume is the casing and electronics of the transformer itself! There is no transformer machine anymore, nothing to control or fix, just a naked quantum-gravity wave sucking in rapidly anything on Earth!

In a thunderous boom the eastern wall of the meeting room collapsed away, exposing a view to the dark, ever-expanding abyss. The floor of the room began to crumble apart.
