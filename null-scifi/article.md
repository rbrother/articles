# Null and void

## Chapter 1

Gordon was walking slowly in the white hall filled with Zenekis transformers.

The invention of the quantum gravity transformer had been made possible by discovery of the quantum gravity unified field equations by group of Rudolph Zenekis in 2080s.

Quantum gravity transformer was by great margin the most disruptive technology of all human history. Bigger than fire, bigger than steam, bigger than electricity, bigger than transistor and microprocessor.

Just like the unified field equation represented physics that looked as complete as a theory can be, the transformed that was based on its principles seemed like a final technology to complete all technology.

it was difficult to envision anything that would go beyond it: the alchemist dream, the transformer could mutate any form of matter to any other form of matter just as instructed. What microprocessor had done to freely process and transform information, Zenekis Transformer had done to freely process and transform matter.

Procter & Gamble corporation was one of the winners in the economic revolution that the transformer had created.  Supply chains disturbed.

I has revolutionized the economy, revolutionized jobs, revolutionized planet earth and  transformed human life.

"Arthur C. Clarke was right", Gordon thought, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indeed indistinguishable from magic". This is exactly the kind of thing that Clarke must have had in mind: Still now, even after watching the technology mature for 25 years and being one of the persons best understanding the operating principle of the transformer, Gordon still felt tingles of magical feeling when he watched matter vanish in a glowing swirl and delicate objects materialize in their place. Human brain had been evolving to expect nature to behave with certain constraints, certain simple rules like Newtons gravity. Brain was not evolved to see events that . To the brain, such events were just magic.

## Chapter 2

Gordons neural assistant chimed a reminder in his ear: "Interview of Irwin Stone, meeting pod Gamma, floor 20". Ah, the new Transformer programmer candidate.

The Transformers only limit was imagination - and programming. The complex dynamic quantum wave patterns in the Transformer required extensive and extremely complex programming. A whole new ecosystem of programming languages, frameworks and libraries had been emerging and a new crop of whiz-kid programmers creating the magic. In the new economy created by the transformers - which was already approaching fast 50% of the total global economy - the programmers that rose above the rest in their ability to develop ever more sophisticated quantum patterns for creation of ever more detailed and delicate objects provided such incredible economical value for their companies that they could command immense salaries.

From early simple spheres and cubes of various atoms, the art has progressed immensely to current creation of sophisticated machines with multiple internal parts, electronics and even soft parts. As the art progressed, conventional factories were one by one being replaced by ever increasing number of huge halls with transformer devices.

Gordon had never considered himself a people person and he would have preferred HR staff to handle the hiring process completely. But they kept reminding him that testing of technical skills was essential and they had no-one in the company with better experience and understanding to created, instruct and assess the test assignments for the wannabe programmers.

Gordon stepped inside the meeting pod. The guy sitting inside seemed to Gordon even younger than the previous crop of Transformer wizards. Made sense: the possible monetary reward for being hired as a lead transformer programmer to one of the big companies was so immense that virtually all kids having any talent for the art were starting to train for that early on. Yet Gordon could not avoid feeling weird about the idea that the company was likely going to pay tens of millions to this kid next week for writing some lines of code.

- Irwin Stone?
- Yes, I am, nice to meet you!
- I am Gordon Wood, I understand that our HR people have been introducing me...?
- Yes, I have read much about you and your early work with professor Zenekis, quite a career! (having been graduate student in Zenekis lab and lead scientist in the process of commercialization of the technology atr various companies)
- I use the core from the Cambridge-variant of the RAPTOR-framework. It's based on the Genial-language but I have developed my own extensions for functional looping which allow faster creation of small recursive structures.
- You can work on the test assignments to create objects in increasing order of complexity: a pencil, microwave owen, motorcycle. Here are high-level specifications for each, but feel free to improvise on the details to demonstrate your design skills.
- You can use the transformers in our beta-lab 7 in the east side of the building, I will connect your laptop to those.
Gordon used the keyboard to set up the connection parameters and user-interface transformer interface software popped on the computer screen.
- Ok, good luck, I will be back in an hour, show us what you got

## Chapter 3

Gordon was sitting in his office browsing through production reports.

He heard some distant rumble. What was that? He returned to browsing the reports.

Another distant rumble. His neural calendar chimed: "Malfunction in beta-lab 7. Connection lost, reconnecting"

What the hell? Gordon stood up and commanded his neural assistant:

- Connect through the wireless network, show me visual from the lab cameras!
- Connection lost, wireless connection lost, visuals not available
- Keep trying to reconnect!

Slightly stronger distant rumble. Gordon got out of the office and started walking towards the east wing of the building through white winding corridors. Other puzzled scientists, engineers and managers were coming out from various rooms. "What is wrong?! What is happening in beta-lab 7?!" he shouted to confused colleagues who were just shrugging without any better understanding.

Strong rumble shook the building . Corridor lights were blinking. Fire-alarm siren started sounding. Gordons neural assistant chimed in: "Fire alarm has been activated. Please proceed to emergency exits."
"Shut up!" responded Gordon. Now he was running through the corridors: still left here, right there... and there was the door of beta-lab 7.

Gordon pulled the door open.

There was no sight of beta-lab 7. On the other side of the door opened vast black abyss. The east side of the building had disappeared, replace by a vast dark pit with smoke, dust and rumble and distant flames emerging from the depths. Behind the dust and smoke rising from the pit, sun looked like a pale red disk.

Gordon just stood there, in silent horror, his brain unable to make sense of the surreal apocalyptic scene that had replaced the familiar white hall with its neat rows of shiny Transformer-devices that has been beta-lab 7.

On the other side of the pit, behind the cloud of dust, Gordon vaguely saw a tall sky-scraper crumble down and break to pieces that continued to fall down towards the darkness and distant flames below.

## Chapter 4

After been stunned by the shock to what seemed like an eternity, some executive part of Gordons brain was finally able to get control and snap him out from the trance. He banged the door shut and started to run away. Now all electricity in the building had failed, the corridors were dark, only illuminated by rows of red emergency lights. The ringing of fire-alarms mixed with steps and screams of colleagues frantically running towards any working exits. He heard the repeated "please evacuate the building" from the neural assistant echoing in his head. But he was not going to evacuate. He had still something else in mind.

Gordon swinged open the door of meeting pod Gamma. Irwin was still there, staring at the Transformer control application screen, frantically typing on the keyboard, his pale sweaty face illuminated only by the emergency lights and green light from the screen.  

- What have you done?! shouted Gordon
- I have been programming the object transformations exactly as you requested. But I still have a bug to fix!
- ItÂ´s gone! It's all gone! The transformers are gone, the beta-lab is gone!
- What do you mean?! I know there is connection problem at the moment.
- Show me the code!

Lines of Genial-code flashed to the screen. Gordon was familiar with hundreds of programming languages, both dead and alive, including this recently fashionable Transformer-programming code. He browsed frantically through the code trying to spot something out of the ordinary. Now loud rumbles were echoing though the room and they could feel the building shaking at each.

Gordon stopped, stood and stared. A dark cold thought crept to his mind as he pointed at a location in the code:

- What is this?!
- This is where I am using my custom looping extension from Genial.
- The debugger shows your rogue extension is returning a null value here!
- What the hell is a "null value"?
- Something that should not exist! This should never happen! For the past 50 years, world has not any more used any any programming language that allows null-values. It means "nothing" and was used long gone programming languages to represent lack of any value.
Now bug in your language extension caused a null value enter into the main Transformer program code. And the null propagated all the way through the logic and to the quantum wave pattern! This should never happen! Such possibility was never taken into account. But in your code it happens! Do you know what that means?!

Irwin just stared at him blankly

- It means that the transformer has a quantum wave pattern that will transform anything into *nothing*! It will consume any material and produce nothing! It will never complete anything so the program is in eternal loop where the quantum wave destroys all material around it without any limit!
- Then shut it down!
- Didn't you hear what I said? It consumes *all* material around it, starting with the casing and electronics of the transformer itself! There is no transformer machine anymore, just a naked quantum wave sucking in anything on earth and in earth!

In a loud rumble the wall of the meeting pod collapsed away, exposing view to the dark ever-expanding pit. The floor of the room started to crumble.
